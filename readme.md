## About
This repository hosts direct download access for recommended base apps (APKs) for patching through [ReVanced](https://revanced.app) Manager and the [Optimal project](https://github.com/gabefletch/optimal-v11). Each app that is patchable through ReVanced Manager has a specific recommended version that will offer the greatest chance of success and/or patch compatibility.<br>

_Apps that list_ `All versions` _will direct you to Google Play rather than a Github release._<br>
_"Non-Universal Download" means that you need to know your device's CPU architecture to get the correct APK._

### How Do I Identify My CPU Architecture?
[Click here](https://github.com/gabefletch/ReVanced-BaseApps/blob/main/cpu-arch-help.md) to learn how. This is only necessary for apps that list "Non-Universal download" above.

## What About (insert app)?
### Reddit
Optimal no longer supports access to any form of modifications applied to the official Reddit app as a decision to deter users from using it in any capacity. Reddit's recent decisions involving their API pricing has made it nearly impossible for third party developers to release their apps and earn a liveable wage from them.
### Other Apps Supported by ReVanced
Many of the other apps that can be patched via ReVanced Manager do not have patches that align with the goal of the Optimal project. For example, Spotify can be patched by ReVanced but does not have patches that unlock Premium features. So Optimal instead supports xManager which does allow for Premium unlocking.
