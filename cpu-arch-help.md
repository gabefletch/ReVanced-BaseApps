# How to Find Your Device's CPU Architecture (Using Inware)
The easiest way to find what CPU architecture your device has is by installing an app called Inware. [Click here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evo.inware&hl=en_US&gl=US) to be taken to its Google Play listing.<br>
Once you have Inware installed, click the "Hardware" button.<br>

Then look under "Supported ABIs" and find an APK that matches what displays for you. (e.g. arm-64 v8-a) Downloading an APK that doesn't match will NOT work on your device.<br>
